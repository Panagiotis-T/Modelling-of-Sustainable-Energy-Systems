# Modelling-of-Sustainable-Energy-Systems

In this report the modelling and optimization of a Domestic Hot Water Heat Pump (DHWHP) under given and
chosen conditions were undertaken. A highly simplified model of heat pump was investigated. The optimization
has been performed for different scenarios in which standardized/realistic demand, fixed/varying electricity
prices and integration of PV/thermal solar panels were considered. The software GAMS was used for the
modelling and calculations.


In this scenario the electricity price is fixed at 2 DKK/kWh. For this case, the demand changes and it follows
a realistic hourly demand.

Scenario 2: Fixed electricity prices and realistic hot water demand

In this scenario, dynamic electricity prices were considered and standardized hot water demand.

Scenario 3: Dynamic electricity prices and standardized hot water demand

In this scenario a photo-voltaic power system is integrated along with heat pump in order to provide electricity
and reduce the total cost of purchased electricity. The electricity price for this model is constant.

Scenario 4: Heat pump integrated with PV panels

In this scenario a solar thermal system is integrated along with heat pump in order to provide heat to the
tank and thus reduce the total operation cost of the heat pump system. The electricity price for this model
is constant.

Scenario 5: Heat pump integrated with solar thermal panels
